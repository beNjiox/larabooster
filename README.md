# Vagrant Laravel Booster

Installing this app will provide you a tiny demo using

* Laravel4 
* Redis
* Memcache
* MySQL

for the lazy people who want to see before read, check this [demo](http://larabooster.io)

In the future I plan to add some new fun things like

* Queues
* Workers
* etc.

## Getting started

------------

To make good use of vagrant you need to download

1. Vagrant ;)

3. Precise32 Box (You can do without, but it's better to have it in local)
