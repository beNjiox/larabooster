# Vagrant Laravel Booster

Installing this app will provide you a tiny demo using

* Laravel4 
* Redis
* Memcache
* MySQL
* And more

for the lazy people who want to see before read, a demo will be soon available.

In the future I plan to add some new fun things like

* Queues
* Workers
* etc.

## Getting started

Requirements
------------

To make good use of vagrant you need to download

1. [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2. [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)
3. Precise32 Box (You can do without, but it's better to have it in local)

Guidelines
----------

```
$ git clone [...]
$ cd vagrant-laravel-booster
$ vagrant up
```

run `http://larabooster.local` in your favorite browser
